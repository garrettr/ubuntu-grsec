Ubuntu kernel with grsecurity
=============================

This guide outlines the steps required to compile a kernel for [Ubuntu
Server 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/)
with [Grsecurity](https://grsecurity.net/), specifically for use with
[SecureDrop](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/securedrop). At the end
of this guide, you will have two Debian packages that you transfer to
the *App* and *Monitor* servers.

## Before you begin

The steps in this guide assume you have the following set up and running:

 * SecureDrop App and Monitor servers (see the [installation
   guide](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/install.md))
 * An offline server running [Ubuntu Server 14.04 (Trusty
   Tahr)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) that you use to compile the
kernel
 * An online server that you use to download package dependencies

The idea is that you will use the online server to download package
dependencies, put the files on a USB stick and transfer them to the
offline server, then use the offline server to verify digital signatures
and compile the new kernel.

The current version of this document assumes you are compiling Linux
kernel version *3.14.21* and Grsecurity version
*3.0-3.14.21-201410131959*. When running commands that include filenames
and/or version numbers, make sure it all matches what you have on your
server.

## Update packages on online and offline servers

Run the following set of commands to ensure all packages are up to date
on the online and offine servers.


```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

## Install dependencies on the offline server

Run the following command to install the package dependencies required
to compile the new kernel with Grsecurity.

```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev build-essential kernel-package git-core gcc-4.8 gcc-4.8-plugin-dev make
```

Create a directory for Grsecurity and download the public keys that you
will later use to verify the Grsecurity and Linux kernel downloads.

```
mkdir grsec
cd grsec/
wget https://grsecurity.net/spender-gpg-key.asc
gpg --import spender-gpg-key.asc
gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 647F28654894E3BD457199BE38DBBDC86092693E
```

At this point, you should disconnect this server from the Internet and
treat it as an offline (air-gapped) server.

## Download kernel and Grsecurity on online server

Create a directory for Grsecurity, the Linux kernel, and the other tools
you will be downloading.

```
mkdir grsec
cd grsec/
```

Make a copy of the *kernel-package* directory on the online server.

```
cp -a /usr/share/kernel-package ubuntu-package
```

When downloading the Linux kernel and Grsecurity, make sure you get the
long term stable versions and that the version numbers match up.

```
wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.14.21.tar.xz
wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.14.21.tar.sign
wget https://grsecurity.net/stable/grsecurity-3.0-3.14.21-201410131959.patch
wget https://grsecurity.net/stable/grsecurity-3.0-3.14.21-201410131959.patch.sig
```

Download the Ubuntu kernel overlay.

```
git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-trusty.git
```

Transfer all the files in the *grsec* directory from the online server
to the offline server using a USB stick.

## Before you compile on the offline server

After moving the files from the online server to the offline server, you
should have the following in your *grsec* directory.

```
grsecurity-3.0-3.14.21-201410131959.patch	    spender-gpg-key.asc
grsecurity-3.0-3.14.21-201410131959.patch.sig	ubuntu-package/
linux-3.14.21.tar.sign				            ubuntu-trusty/
linux-3.14.21.tar.xz
```

### Gather the required files for the Ubuntu kernel overlay

Copy the required directories from the Ubuntu kernel overlay directory
to the correct *ubuntu-package* directory.

```
cp ubuntu-trusty/debian/control-scripts/p* ubuntu-package/pkg/image/
cp ubuntu-trusty/debian/control-scripts/headers-postinst ubuntu-package/pkg/headers/
```

### Verify the digital signatures

Verify the digital signature for Grsecurity.

```
gpg --verify grsecurity-3.0-3.14.21-201410131959.patch.sig
```

Verify the digital signature for the Linux kernel.

```
unxz linux-3.14.21.tar.xz
gpg --verify linux-3.14.21.tar.sign
```

Do not move on to the next step until you have successfully verified both
signatures. If either of the signatures fail to verify, go back to the online
server, re-download both the package and signature and try again.

### Apply Grsecurity patch to the Linux kernel

Extract the Linux kernel archive and apply the Grsecurity patch.

```
tar -xf linux-3.14.21.tar
cd linux-3.14.21/
patch -p1 < ../grsecurity-3.0-3.14.21-201410131959.patch
```

### Configure Grsecurity

Configure Grsecurity with the following command.

```
make menuconfig
```

You will want to follow the steps below to select and configure the
correct options.

 * Navigate to *Security options*
   * Navigate to *Grsecurity*
     * Press *Y* to include it
     * Set *Configuration Method* to *Automatic*
     * Set *Usage Type* to *Server* (default)
     * Set *Virtualization Type* to *None* (default) 
     * Set *Required Priorities* to *Security*
     * Select *Exit*
   * Select *Exit* 
 * Select *Exit*
 * Select *Yes* to save

### Compile the kernel with Grsecurity

Use all available cores when compiling the kernel.


```
export CONCURRENCY_LEVEL="$(grep -c '^processor' /proc/cpuinfo)"
```

Compile the kernel with the Ubuntu overlay. Note that this step may fail
if you are using a small VPS/virtual machine.

```
make-kpkg clean  
sudo make-kpkg --initrd --overlay-dir=../ubuntu-package kernel_image kernel_headers 
```

When the build process is done, you will have the following Debian
packages in the *grsec* directory:

```
linux-headers-3.14.21-grsec_3.2.61-grsec-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb
linux-image-3.14.21-grsec_3.2.61-grsec-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb
```

Put the packages on a USB stick and transfer them to the SecureDrop App
and Monitor servers.

## Set up PaX on App and Monitor servers

Proceed with the following steps only if the SecureDrop App and Monitor
servers are up and running.

Both servers need to have PaX installed and configured. PaX is part of
common security-enhancing kernel patches and secure distributions, such
as Grsecurity.

```
sudo apt-get install paxctl
sudo paxctl -Cpm /usr/sbin/grub-probe  
sudo paxctl -Cpm /usr/sbin/grub-mkdevicemap  
sudo paxctl -Cpm /usr/sbin/grub-setup  
sudo paxctl -Cpm /usr/bin/grub-script-check  
sudo paxctl -Cpm /usr/bin/grub-mount  
```

### Ensure the web server can start on the App server

The following commands ensure the web server can start and should
**only** be run on the App server.

```
sudo schroot -a -u root --directory / service apache2 stop
sudo paxctl -cm /var/chroot/source/usr/sbin/apache2
sudo paxctl -cm /var/chroot/document/usr/sbin/apache2
sudo schroot -a -u root --directory / service apache2 start
```

### Install new kernel on both App and Monitor servers

Install the new kernel with Grsecurity on both servers.

```
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
sudo update-grub
```

### Disable conflicting jail restrictions on the App server

The following commands disable conflicting jail restrictions and should
**only** be run on the App server.

```
sudo su -
echo "kernel.grsecurity.chroot.caps = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "kernel.grsecurity.chroot.deny.unix = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
```

### Configure App and Monitor servers to use new kernel by default

Set the new kernel to be the default on both servers. Start by finding
the exact menuentry name for the kernel.

```
grep menuentry /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

Copy the output and use it in the *sed* command below to set this kernel
as the default.

```
sudo sed -i "s/^GRUB_DEFAULT=.*$/GRUB_DEFAULT=\"2>Ubuntu, with Linux 3.14.21-grsec\"/" /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

### Test SecureDrop functionality

Before you move on to the final step, ensure that SecureDrop is working
as expected by testing SSH, browsing to the .onion sites, completing the
submission and reply process, and so on.

### Lock it down

Once you have confirmed that everything works, configure the Grsecurity
lock in *sysctl.conf*.

```
sudo su -
echo "kernel.grsecurity.grsec_lock = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
exit
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
```
